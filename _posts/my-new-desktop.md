If you're into gaming and deep learning, you need to own a GPU. For
          years I was working with an older GPU (GTX 960M), but I thought it was
          time to upgrade. But wait, should I get a laptop, a pre-built
          desktop, or just build my own ? It took me weeks to decide, and now I
          can say that I don't regret my decision in hindsight. I ended up
          assembling a desktop from scratch, and I must say, it was a great
          experience !

### 
          Why build your own desktop?

        There are multiple advantages:

            Cost Effective

              It's way cheaper as compared to buying pre-built desktops.

                There are plenty of options on the market, like HP Omen series,
                CLX custom builds, ROG desktop series, etc. I ended up adding
                better parts and saved approximately 600$ !

            Customizable and Upgradable

                If a part falls out, it might not be easy to replace it in a
                pre-built desktop. I've read about such builds having little to
                no space b/w parts.

                Future GPU and CPU upgrades are easier if you've installed the
                parts yourself.

                Normally, people end up adding more fans which prolongs the life
                of CPU and other components.

          Notes

            I would recommend replacing the CPU cooler with another one, since
            the mounts on this one didn't fit the AM4 socket on the motherboard.

            Currently, there is a massive chip shortage due to covid and other
            supply chain issues in China. GPUs are hard to come by. I would
            recommend buying a used GPU (make sure it wasn't used for crypto
            mining), or asking a friend who works at Nvidia to get you one.
