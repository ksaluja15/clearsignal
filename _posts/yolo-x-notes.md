Motivation

            The main motivation behind YOLOX was to update the YOLO series with
            the recent advancements at the time, particularly anchor-free
            detection.

            When YoloX came out in 2021, YOLOv5 held the best trade-off
            performance with 48.2% AP on COCO at 13.7 ms. This inference time
            was calculated using YOLOv5-L model at 640 Ã— 640 resolution with
            FP16-precision and batch=1 on a V100.

            YOLOv4 and YOLOv5 still used anchor-based detectors with
            hand-crafted assigning rules for training.

          Novelty

            This paper chose Yolov3 as the baseline and added incremental
            improvements to it, such as:

            Anchor free detection

                Eliminates the need for clustering analysis to determine optimal
                anchor sizes. Such anchors are domain-specific and less
                generalized.

                Anchors increase complexity in two ways. Firstly, the number of
                predictions from the detection heads is too high. This can cause
                potential memory bottlenecks. Secondly, anchors are associated
                with several tightly tuned design parameters, making decoding
                harder.

              The anchor-free concept appears to have been adapted from the{" "}

            SimOTA label assignment

              YoloX adopts a simplified version of the label assignment strategy
              created by the same authors in the{" "}

              {" "}
              paper. Labels are matched to the predictions based on a cost
              value (weighted sum of losses). Then an IOU is calculated relative
              to the sampled center (center-sampling from{" "}

              ) to determine the top k matches, also known as the Dynamic-k
              strategy.

              Strong augmentation - Mosaic and Mixup

              Strong augmentation ensures that pre-training with Imagenet is no
              longer beneficial. Models are trained from scratch with this
              augmentation.
